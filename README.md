# **Forecasting Urban Air Quality Index using ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA): Coventry as a Case Study**
---
## Project Overview
---
This research aims to develop sophisticated time series forecasting models (ARIMA and SARIMA) for Coventry's air quality by integrating both pollutant measurements and meteorological data. The project will analyze:

# **Pollutant Dynamics**

### Primary Pollutants

* NO (Nitric Oxide) from direct emissions
* PM10 and PM25 from various urban sources
* Differentiation between volatile (V25) and non-volatile (NV25) particulate components

### Secondary Pollutants

* NO2 formation from NO oxidation
* O3 generation through photochemical processes
* Total nitrogen oxides (NOXasNO2)

### Meteorological Influences

#### **Wind Parameters**

* Direction (M_DIR): Impact on pollutant transport
* Speed (M_SPED): Effect on dispersion rates

#### **Temperature Effects (M_T)**

* Influence on chemical reaction rates
* Impact on seasonal pollution patterns
* Role in photochemical smog formation
